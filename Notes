Pin Configuration 

nRFL01+ pins            ATmega328p pins
    CE          -->         D9         
    CSN         -->         D10
    SCK         -->         D13
    MOSI        -->         D11
    MISO        -->         D12
    IRQ         -->         D2

Pull down resistor on D2

------------------------------------------------------------

Interrupts when
1-Rx Received a packet
2-TX sent a packet successfully
3-TX failed to send a packet (must unset bit to continue)

Enhanced ShockBurst
-Used for automatic packet handling and timing
	-Searches for packets, validates CRC, then moves payload to RX FIFO upon success

Packet Format
-Preamble (1 Byte) set of alternating bits (pattern depends on first bit of address such that it alternates) used to signify that there is data coming.
-Address (3-5 Bytes)
-Packet Control Field (9 bit) 
	-Payload length in bytes (6 bits), 
	-Packet identity used to signify if packet received is new or retransmitted so that same data is not sent to MCU twice (2 bit),
	-NO_ACK flag (1 bit)
-Payload (0-32 Bytes)


CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)
-Similar to a checksum which is used to validate packets that are received
	-Advantage over Checksum is that its easier to find where in the data there was corruption
-Appends all data together then divides and uses remainder to create a polynomial
-1 byte CRC uses an 8th degree polynomial. 2 Byte uses 16 degree polynomial.

TODO
Interrupts in status register
Read count loss packets register (OBSERVE_TX add 0x08)
Read from FIFO_STATUS register on tx


CONFIGURATION
All interrupts enabled
2 byte CRC
3 byte address
Wait 250 us before retransmission of packets
3 retransmission attempts
Operates on frequency channel 2
Output power 0dBm
Read/Writes happen to the MSBit of LSByte. Can terminate read/write before accessing entire register
Dynamic Payload length enabled

----------------------------------------------------

Rx Setup
Send ACTIVATE command through SPI (01010000 0x73)
Enable Auto_ACK and dynamic payload length
1D -> 110
Setup Register
00 -> 00001111
Set Address length to 3 bytes
03 -> 1
Set RX_ADDR_P0
0A -> 0x787878
Enable Dynamic payload length
1C -> 0x1
Send FLUSH_RX
Set CE high (wait 130 us)

When IRQ pin is high
Send command R_RX_PL_WID (0110 0000) to get size of payload
Read from RX_FIFO
Set RX_DR in status to low
Send R_RX_PL_WID command to read length of payload

-----------------------------------------------------

Tx Setup
Send ACTIVATE command through SPI 
01010000 0x73
Enable Auto_ACK and dynamic payload length
1D -> 110
Setup Register
00 -> 00001110
Set Address length to 3 bytes
03 -> 1
Set RX_ADDR_P0
0A -> 0x787878
Set TX_ADDR same as RX_ADDR_P0
10 -> 0x787878
Send FLUSH_TX
Set CE high (wait 10 us)

WHEN THERE IS DATA
Write payload

Check for TX_DS in status reg (success)
Check for MAX_RT in status reg (fail. Must reset MAX_RT in status reg)
